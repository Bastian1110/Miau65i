# Miau6502 Improved 
A programming language for Ben Eater's 6502, using the assembler syntaxis presented in Ben's videos

## History
Some time ago, I wanted to develop a small compiler for Ben Eater's computer, however, I want to improve it, so I can do more complex things with it. The other programming language I did was a good approach, however, it lacked many features which I could not implement at the time. Therefore, I have decided to use a new way to solve the problem.

#### **WARNING : Currently in development**

## Objectives
1. Typed language
2. Support functions for 65C22
3. Support functions for LCD Display
4. Implement an standard libary
