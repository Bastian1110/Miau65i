# Miau6502 Improved ðŸ§¶
A programming language for Ben Eater's 6502, using the assembler syntaxis presented in Ben's videos

## History
Some time ago, I wanted to develop a small compiler for Ben Eater's computer, however, I want to improve it, so I can do more complex things with it. The other programming language I did was a good approach, however, it lacked many features which I could not implement at the time. Therefore, I have decided to use a new way to solve the problem.

#### **WARNING : Currently in development**

## Objectives
1. Typed language
2. Support functions for 65C22
3. Support functions for LCD Display
4. Implement an standard libary

## How it works ?
This compiler will implement the most basic and common algorithms that are 
normally in a compiler. This to demonstrate the way a compiler work (and a little bit of a challenge for myself ðŸ˜…). The main parts of the compiler are described below 

## Lexer 
For the implementation of the lexer, I decided that I didnt want to use additional libaries, so I implemented a solution that uses the regexp Go libary to tokenize a string, this given the following rules : 
```
	rules["float"] = "([0-9]*[.])+[0-9]+"
	rules["int"] = "[0-9]+"
	rules["var"] = "[a-zA-Z_]+"
	rules["ass"] = "\\="
	rules["add"] = "\\+"
	rules["sub"] = "\\-"
	rules["okey"] = "\\{"
	rules["ckey"] = "\\}"
	rules["opar"] = "\\("

```
I'm currentl working in the defintion of all the rules, alog the way I build de parser

## Parser
To implement the parser, I decided I will use the Recursive Descent Method, with a Context Free Grammar  that will prove if all the lines in the source code are valid for the code generator

## Installation
Clone this repository on your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/Bastian1110/Miau65i 
```
